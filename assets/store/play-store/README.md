Stop guessing your settings. Start tracking.

Do you keep your suspension clicks, tire pressures, and geometry settings scattered across a messy notes app? Do you struggle to remember exactly what setup felt perfect on that rainy day in the bike park last season?

Bike Setup Tracker is the ultimate digital logbook for cyclists, mechanics, and racers who want to get the most out of their equipment. Whether you are a Downhill racer, an Enduro enthusiast, or a Road cyclist, this app brings structure to your bike adjustments.

Key Features:

🚲 Manage Your Garage: Add as many bikes as you want to your virtual garage. Whether you have a gravel bike, a dedicated downhill rig, or a cross-country racer, keep them all organized in one place.

🔧 Fully Customizable Components: No two bikes are the same. Create custom components with the specific adjustments you need to track.
- Suspension: Track Air Pressure (PSI), Rebound clicks, Compression (HSC/LSC), and Volume Spacers (Tokens).
- Tires: Log pressures (PSI/Bar) and compounds.
- Cockpit: Note saddle height, bar roll, and lever angles.
- Frame: Track flip-chip positions or geometry adjustments.
- Flexible Inputs: Use sliders, toggle switches, dropdown menus, or number fields to match the real-world adjustment dials on your bike.

🌤️ Automatic Weather & Location Context: Context is everything. When you create a new setup, the app automatically fetches the current weather, temperature, and location.
- Was the trail dry and dusty?
- Was it a wet and muddy race run?
- Now you can correlate your settings with the actual trail conditions.

📝 Setup History & Evolution: Never lose a good setup again. Browse your detailed history to see exactly what you changed and when. Compare your current setup to previous sessions (e.g., "Finale Ligure Trip" vs. "Local Trails").

Who is this for?
- Mountain Bikers (MTB): Perfect for finding the sweet spot on complex suspension systems.
- Road & Gravel Cyclists: precise tracking for tire pressures and fit adjustments.
- Racers: Keep a log of your race-day tunes.
